            I was born in Konya in 2003, but I am originally from Niğde. I am 21 years old and currently a third-year Computer Engineering student at Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University. I have a strong interest in technology and software development.
            In my free time, I enjoy knitting and listening to music. I enjoy going for walks and trying new things. I also love watching movies and doing TV series marathons. Meeting new people and experiencing different perspectives excites me.
